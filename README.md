# Ingredient Substitution using Text and Knowledge Graph Embeddings
This repository contains the code and additional materials for the MSc Data Science project titled "Ingredient Substitution using Text and Knowledge Graph Embeddings". The project aims to develop a scalable and efficient model for ingredient substitution by leveraging a hybrid approach combining text-based language models (Word2Vec, BERT) and Knowledge Graph models (Node2Vec, GraphSAGE, GCN). The objective is to create contextually aware substitutions tailored to individual recipes.
### Introduction
The project addresses ingredient substitution in recipes by integrating both text-based and graph-based approaches to generate substitutes. The goal is to improve model scalability and accuracy in ingredient substitution using a unique combination of NLP and knowledge graph techniques.
